# ADIF2QSL_webtool

An experimental webtool which produces printable QSL cards from ADIF files.

## Usage
- Open "index.html" on your browser.
- Choose ADIF file.
- Printable QSL Cards are generated dynamically and displayed.

## Script files included

- adif_parser.js  
  Originated from [K0SWE's adif-parser-ts](https://github.com/k0swe/adif-parser-ts) (typescript)
- [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [moment-timezone.js](https://momentjs.com/timezone/)

Codes I developped are written directly in index.html, which may be separated as independent .js or .css files later.
